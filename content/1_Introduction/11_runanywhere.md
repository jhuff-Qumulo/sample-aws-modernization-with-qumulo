# **Qumulo RunAnywhere Architecture**


## **Introduction**  

Qumulo‚Äôs RunAnywhere architecture allows the file data platform to run consistently across cloud, edge, and on-prem environments. This flexibility is central to enabling hybrid workflows ‚Äî giving organizations the power to process, move, and manage data wherever it makes the most business sense.

  üó£Ô∏è Run the same high-performance, multi-protocol (NFS/SMB/S3) data platform on the hardware and clouds you choose‚Äîmanage it as one system‚Äîso data is always close to users and apps, without vendor lock-in.

## **Buiness Outcomes**  
 **Freedom of choice:** Deploy on your preferred servers and any major cloud. Avoid lock-in, reuse existing investments, and negotiate better pricing.

**Global access, local speed:** Project data to edge sites/studios/branches while keeping authoritative copies centralized‚Äîusers get low-latency access without making (and managing) full copies everywhere.

**Cloud-smart economics:** Scale performance and capacity independently; burst in cloud when needed; keep cold data cheap while hot working sets stay fast.

**Operational simplicity:** One platform, one toolset, one policy framework (auth, quotas, snapshots, replication) everywhere‚Äîreduces admin overhead and failure modes.

**No app changes:** Standard file/object interfaces mean existing workflows and permissions just work across on-prem and cloud.

**Resilience by design:** Snapshots, replication, and hub-and-spoke ‚Äúportals‚Äù support HA/DR patterns without complex re-architecture.

**Why this matters?**

- Multi-site content creation/collaboration (studios, labs, branches)

- Hybrid cloud analytics/AI pipelines that need the same data in multiple places

- Migrations off proprietary appliances to commodity servers + cloud

**Proof points to measure in a POC**

- Time to deploy and share data (minutes/hours, not weeks)

- Latency/throughput at edge vs. legacy copy-everywhere models

- Admin hours saved (single policy & monitoring plane)

- \$/TB and \$/GB-served when tiering/bursting to cloud

### **Next Steps**  

- Dive deeper in to Cloud Native Qumulo (CNQ) and understand the principals of Run Anywhere in action as referred to the use case in the cloud
- Understand how Qumulo's Cloud Data Fabric (CDF) leverages Run Anywhere and CNQ to help customers with their challenges around data access, mobility, and management.
